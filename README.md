## Why this?

I'd dabbled with NodeJS before, but it wasn't until 2 months ago(Oct 2016) that I really tried to put as much of everything together to serve as a decent basis for web development for beginners.

I started with the [Web Development With Node and Express](https://github.com/EthanRBrown/web-development-with-node-and-express) book by Ethan Brown. But soon I realized, since the book was published in 2014, lots that were covered in the book have changed, and things that weren't covered but have gained tractions since then. 

Therefore, this repo consolidates and structures all of my knowledges of the opinions/experiences from StackOverflow's users, blog posts, and official docs regarding various aspects of the book, libraries and more, hoping that this would ease a beginner's learning experience that could get somewhat overwhelming like it did for me trying to catch up in the sea of information towards the latest developments.
